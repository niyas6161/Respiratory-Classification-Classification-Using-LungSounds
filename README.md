The Respiratory Disease Classification System is an innovative tool designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing respiratory diseases based on lung sounds. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, specifically CNN and GRU models, the system analyzes audio recordings of lung sounds to classify various respiratory conditions accurately.

This project aims to classify respiratory diseases based on lung sound recordings. The dataset used for this project is the Respiratory Sound Database available on Kaggle.

Welcome to our respiratory health repository. Using CNN algorithms, we detect URTI, Bronchiolitis, pneumonia, COPD. Our platform offers real-time auscultation and long-term monitoring tools. Accessible via our user-friendly website, input disease audio for instant predictions. Join us in improving pulmonary diagnostics and patient outcomes

Respiratory sounds are important indicators of respiratory health and respiratory disorders. The sound emitted when a person breathes is directly related to air movement, changes within lung tissue and the position of secretions within the lung. A wheezing sound, for example, is a common sign that a patient has an obstructive airway disease like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

These sounds can be recorded using digital stethoscopes and other recording techniques. This digital data opens up the possibility of using machine learning to automatically diagnose respiratory disorders like asthma, pneumonia and bronchiolitis, to name a few.
